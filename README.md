# Computer-Vision
Implementation of three image classification models using different combinations of feature descriptors and classifiers to perform Face Covering Detection (FCD).

1. Model 1: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) + Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2. Model 2: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + SVM

3. Model 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Subsequently, a MaskDetection function was implemented on a personal video, using the best of the three models (CNN).

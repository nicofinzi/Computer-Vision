Implementation of three image classification models using different combinations of feature descriptors and classifiers to perform Face Covering Detection (FCD).

1. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) + Support Vector Machine (SVM) model

2. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + SVM model

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model

Subsequently, a MaskDetection function was implemented on a personal video, using the best of the three models (CNN).
